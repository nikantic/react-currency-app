# React Currency App

Currency Exchange App done in React and Redux. This project and proof of concept started as something small (simple app to display exchange rates) and grew into full blown React app with real time conversions, notifications, saved conversions and store management in Redux. Deployed on Zeit (now Vercel).

## Notes

- Due to Exchange Rates API changes app is no longer using the newest currency rates. Local sample currency data is used instead.

## Features:

- React dashboard Single Page Application with React Router
- Redux state management (Notifications, Saved Transactions etc.)
- Integrated Charts Component to compare currencies
- Search Component and functionality
- Cool design and UX with SVGs
