# React Currency App

Currency Exchange App done in React and Redux. This project started as something small (simple app to display exchange rates) and grew into this full blown React app with real time conversions and store management in Redux. Deployed on Zeit (now Vercel).

## Notes

- Due to Exchange Rates API changes app is no longer using the newest updated currency rates. Local saved sample currency data is used instead.

## Features:

- React dashboard Single Page Application with React Router
- Redux state management (Notifications, Saved Transactions etc.)
- Integrated Charts Component to compare currencies
- Search Component and functionality
- Cool design and UX with SVGs
